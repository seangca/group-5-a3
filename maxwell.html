          </div>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Maxwell was my first cat, and he was the runt of his litter. He also
            had some complications with a surgery, and that meant he had to wait
            to be adopted, so he was very lonely before I came to get him – his
            whole litter had gone! However, because of that, he was extremely
            affectionate and clingy. He was also a very large cat, so when he
            sat on my lap it didn’t take long for my legs to fall asleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            I adopted Mona when he was about a year and a half old, and they
            initially didn’t get along, but they did eventually grow to like
            each other. They would often lay together and he would groom Mona
            until she got cranky about it. Very funny to watch!
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, I had to say goodbye to Maxwell way sooner than I
            would have liked – it turns out, he was born with only one kidney
            (among other issues, like the one mentioned when he was young), and
            he got a kidney infection. We were able to treat it, but it returned
            several months later, and the vet said there was no way he would
            make it. He was only 6 years old. He is missed greatly, but he left
            a big impact on everyone’s lives, and lived his best and was well
            taken care of!
          </p>
